# LEFO Standalone Scripts 

## What is this?
Standalone scripts, or tools, mostly using R, Python or Bash, that members of the [Plant Functional Ecology Laboratory (LEFO)](https://lefo.ca) put together. The tools cover various data processing and analysis tasks that we commonly do using different softwares or platforms.

## Softwares or platforms

* **3DFin**: related to [3D Forest INventory](https://github.com/3DFin/3DFin)
* **DJI**: related to DJI products such as D-RTK 2 base station logs
* **Labelbox**: related to Labelbox, an online labeling platform
* **Metashape**: related to Agisoft Metashape, a software used for photogrammetry
* **lefoai**: scripts to be used on our Linux server

## How to find the scripts
First go to the folder corresponding to the software or platform of interest. Every single tool, or standalone script, should be in a separate file with a short name that should allow you to find it. A README file should be available in each folder to explain the different files.

> Clone the repo on your computer to run a script. A list of required libraries is available inside each script, usually in the header.

## How to contribute

1. Clone the repo
2. Always pull before you start
3. Create a file / folder for your script at the right place
4. Preferably, the script should be in R (.R), Python (.py) or Bash (.sh)
5. Add any files / folders too large for Github to the `.gitignore` file
6. Modify the README inside the folder to explain the new script briefly
7. Commit the changes
8. Push to GitHub
